.SH NAME
qshell \- COMP3301 Operating Systems Shell project
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qshell
[\fIFILE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqshell\fR is a minimalist shell program. It works similarly to \fBbash\fR, prompting for a command line and running commands, but does not have many of the special features of the \fBbash\fR shell.
.PP
\fBqshell\fR supports redirection of standard input/output (< >), use of unnamed pipes (|), background processes (&) and comments (#). It includes two built-in commands, \fBexit\fR and \fBcd\fR.
.PP
If a \fIFILE\fR argument is given, commands are read from the \fIFILE\fR; otherwise, \fBqshell\fR launches in interactive mode and prompts for commands.
.SH OPTIONS
\-
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
if OK,
.TP
1
for minor problems (e.g. cannot access \fIFILE\fR given)
.TP
2
for serious trouble (e.g. memory issues, internal errors)
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The behaviour of \fBqshell\fR is affected by the following environment variables.
.IP "\fBPATH\fR" 
\fBqshell\fR uses the PATH variable to look for commands.
.IX Item "PATH"
.IP "\fBHOME\fR" 
When the command \fBcd\fR is used without arguments, the shell changes directories to the directory specified by HOME.
.IX Item "HOME"
.SH FILES
.IX Header "FILES"
.IP "\fBqshell\fR" 
.IX Item "qshell"
The executable binary.

.SH "SUPPORTED SHELL SYNTAX"
.IX Header "SUPPORTED SHELL SYNTAX"
.IP "command [arg1 arg2 ...] [< input_file] [> output_file] [&]" 
or
.IX Item "cmdline1"
.IP "command [arg1 arg2 ...] [> output_file] [< input_file] [&]" 
or
.IX Item "cmdline2"
.IP "command [arg1 ...] [< input_file] | command2 [arg1 ...] [> output_file]" 
 
.IX Item "cmdline3"
.SH INBUILT COMMANDS
.PP
The following commands have inbuilt definitions, which override any available programs of the same name available on the PATH. 
.PP
They do not follow \fBSHELL SYNTAX\fR as above in that they do not support pipes, backgrounding or input/output redirection.
.TP
\fBcd\fR [\fIDIR\fR]
Change directory to \fIDIR\fR if supplied; else change directory to HOME.
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Exits the shell, ignoring any arguments
.SH NOTES
.PP
In comparison to \fBbash\fR, \fBqshell\fR has many limitations. Notable ones include:
.TP
\-
Chaining of pipes (|) is not supported. Only one pipe per command line
.TP
\-
Background execution (&) may not be used with piped commands
.TP
\-
Only space characters count as whitespace. Tabs and other whitespace characters are treated as text commands/arguments.
.TP
\-
The shell does not support quoting (" or '). All spaces are treated as argument separators.
.TP
\-
Command lines longer than 128 characters or with more than 20 space-separated arguments are not supported.
.PP
Pressing Ctrl-C will terminate the foreground command currently running, but will not terminate the shell or background processes.
